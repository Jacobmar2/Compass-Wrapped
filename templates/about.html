        <h3>What is Compass Wrapped?</h3>
        <p>
            A “Spotify Wrapped” style transit ridership stats generator for Compass Card data
        </p>
        <p>
            Compass-Wrapped takes your Compass Card CSV file and generates a fun, shareable “Wrapped” style 
            summary of your annual transit usage. It shows stats like:
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            
            ● 🎉 Total trips taken, as well as SkyTrain, SeaBus, WCE trips<br>
            ● 🚉 Top 5 most-used SkyTrain stations<br>
            ● 🗺️ Stations you’ve never visited<br>
            ● Hours of the day bar graph<br>
            ● Days of the week bar graph<br>
            </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to make your ridership patterns visual and shareable, similar to Spotify Wrapped.

                ● Each trip is counted by each tap on a bus or each pair of taps on SkyTrain/SeaBus/WCE.
            </p>
            <p>
                ● SkyTrain trips are counted once for every 2 taps (entering and exiting) and for hours of day, days of week bar graphs
                (entrance timestamp only, just like buses), while station usage are counted both for each entry and each exit.
            </p>

                ● Your CSV files will be private and will never be saved or uploaded anywhere. No data generated here will be saved anywhere either.
            </p>
            <p>
                ● You may insert a time range shorter than a year, where all of the stats except for average number of trips 
                per day/week/month (in the green box) will stay accurate
